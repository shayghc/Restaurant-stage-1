#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

The **Restaurant Reviews** project requires an incremental conversion of a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, work has been completed to change the presentation of the site in terms of a responsive layout to optimise presentation in all screen sizes.

Accessibility has been address and checked in both AXE and Chrome Dev Tools audits.

A third requirement was to add a service worker to provide offline access.

### What have I achieved?

1. CSS was used to provide responsive design to the pages while maintaining normal flow.

2. Accessibility features have been added.

3. A service worker is registered and installed with required files cached by the service worker for use offline.

### Issues

More than three weeks has been spent investigating the fetch event for the service worker including taking a further course (Google Developers Practice Labs). A simple fetch event is included in the sw.js file. Several different format for this fetch event have been tried yet none function offline.
